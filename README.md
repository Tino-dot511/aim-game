# aim-game
This is a game where you have to click as many squares as you can in an amount of time set by yourself. This is designed to test your accuracy and clicking speed, which is perfect practice for first-person or third-person shooter gamers. As a fan of many shooter based games, this project was incredibly new and fun for me, allowing me to learn basics about GUI programming and simple gaming logic.
After picking a time, you are pushed straight into the game and after clicking a square, it disappears but another one immediately appears, keeping a fast pace and keeping you on your toes.
With the help of AI tools to point out mistakes, I was able to code a basic, yet clean and functional aim tester game that includes event handling, collision/overlapping logic and GUI programming.
